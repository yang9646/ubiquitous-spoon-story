An old man recently retired from his jobs, which he fully committed to. His priority was success in his profession. So he thought spending time unrelated to his job is a waste. As a result, he became 
successful that he gained comparable amount of wealth that he can spend for the rest of his life. He thought he would be happy if he has enough wealth to spend, but in fact, he was not. He looked 
back of his past and what he can remember is work, work, and work. He forgot what he loved to do when he was young. As he no longer has job, what is left to him is only time and wealth. But these 
were useless as he does not know how to spend wealth and time. Time keeps going on, but he still does not know what to do. This caused his doubts on his belief, which was that success is ultimate 
goal of life. As the doubts grow on, he felt devastated. One day, he did not want to feel such that way so he decided to go out without destination. He just follow the way his legs led.
